prototype android application built in a few days, held together by ducktape

i made this since I realized amie was only on ios, and pitched them this

basically zero external dependencies, written in compose

features:
- autoscroll drag & drop
- animated date indicator
- split screen effect
- create & add dynamic todos to calendar w/ timestamp
- animated pie chart

things to do:
- performance optimization for recompositions
- automated tests
- integration with api
- consistency with design, such as fonts, animations, icons, etc.
- account for various screen sizes
